b2c applications

    Follow the instructions in
    
        https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-create-user-flows?pivots=b2c-custom-policy
    
    to set up the following Identity Experience Framework applications:

        IdentityExperienceFramework
        ProxyIdentityExperienceFramework

    We already have the custom policies checked in here so we can skip the "Custom policy starter pack" section 
    We are not using other identity providers so skip the "Add Facebook as an identity provider" section.
    The custom policies files are already tokenized so don't replace the values in the files. 
    Custom policy files will be uploaded when the environment is deployed.
    Update the <env>.js config file with the following values

        identityExperienceFrameworkClientId:      "",
        proxyIdentityExperienceFrameworkClientId: "",
